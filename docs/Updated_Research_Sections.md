## 4. Experimental Design and Methodology

### 4.1 System Architecture and Implementation

Our Linux kernel optimization framework implements a novel hybrid approach combining Bayesian Optimization and Genetic Algorithms with real-time process monitoring and EEVDF scheduler compatibility. The system architecture consists of six core components:

1. **Hybrid Optimization Engine**: Intelligently switches between Bayesian Optimization and Genetic Algorithm based on optimization progress and workload characteristics
2. **Process Workload Detector**: Real-time monitoring system that classifies running processes into workload categories (web server, database, compute-intensive, I/O-intensive)
3. **Kernel Parameter Interface**: EEVDF-aware parameter management with support for Linux kernel 6.6+ scheduler changes
4. **Performance Monitor**: Multi-metric system performance evaluation using CPU utilization, memory usage, I/O statistics, and system responsiveness
5. **Process Priority Manager**: Dynamic process priority adjustment using nice/renice commands integrated with kernel parameter optimization
6. **Continuous Optimization Daemon**: Service-based continuous operation with automatic workload adaptation

### 4.2 EEVDF Scheduler Adaptation

With the transition from CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) to EEVDF (Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First) in Linux kernel 6.6+, traditional scheduler parameters have been relocated or deprecated:

- **Deprecated Parameters**: `kernel.sched_min_granularity_ns`, `kernel.sched_wakeup_granularity_ns`, `kernel.sched_migration_cost_ns` (moved to `/sys/kernel/debug/sched/`)
- **New EEVDF Parameters**: 
  - `kernel.sched_cfs_bandwidth_slice_us`: Controls time slice allocation for bandwidth management
  - `kernel.sched_rr_timeslice_ms`: Round-robin time slice for real-time processes
  - `kernel.sched_rt_period_us` and `kernel.sched_rt_runtime_us`: Real-time scheduling constraints

Our implementation adapts by:
1. **Parameter Detection**: Automatic detection of available parameters based on kernel version
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Default values for unavailable parameters with informative logging
3. **Priority-Based Optimization**: Integration of process priority management (nice values) as primary optimization lever
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Combining kernel parameter tuning with dynamic process priority adjustment

### 4.3 Optimization Strategy Selection

The system employs four distinct optimization strategies:

1. **Bayesian-Only**: Gaussian Process-based optimization ideal for smooth, continuous parameter spaces
2. **Genetic-Only**: Population-based global optimization effective for multimodal landscapes
3. **Hybrid Sequential**: Bayesian exploration followed by genetic exploitation
4. **Adaptive**: Dynamic strategy switching based on real-time optimization progress

Strategy selection criteria:
- **Parameter Dimensionality**: Bayesian preferred for ≤10 parameters, Genetic for >10
- **Evaluation Budget**: Bayesian for limited evaluations (<50), Genetic for larger budgets
- **Time Constraints**: Bayesian for quick optimization, Genetic for comprehensive search
- **Workload Characteristics**: Adaptive approach for dynamic workloads

### 4.4 Performance Evaluation Framework

#### 4.4.1 Workload Classification System

Our system automatically classifies workloads using process analysis with regex patterns:

```
- Web Server: nginx, apache, httpd processes
- Database: mysql, postgres, mongodb, redis processes  
- Compute: scientific computing, machine learning workloads
- I/O Intensive: file servers, backup operations
- Mixed: General desktop/server workloads
```

Each workload type triggers specific optimization profiles:
- **Web Server Profile**: Optimizes for low latency and high concurrency
- **Database Profile**: Balances I/O performance with memory management
- **Compute Profile**: Maximizes CPU efficiency and process scheduling
- **I/O Profile**: Optimizes disk access patterns and buffer management

#### 4.4.2 Multi-Metric Performance Assessment

Performance evaluation uses a composite scoring function:

```python
def composite_performance_score(metrics):
    # CPU efficiency (40% weight)
    cpu_score = 1.0 - (metrics['cpu_usage'] / 100.0)
    
    # Memory efficiency (25% weight)  
    memory_score = 1.0 - (metrics['memory_percent'] / 100.0)
    
    # I/O responsiveness (20% weight)
    io_score = calculate_io_responsiveness(metrics)
    
    # System stability (15% weight)
    stability_score = calculate_system_stability(metrics)
    
    return (0.4 * cpu_score + 0.25 * memory_score + 
            0.2 * io_score + 0.15 * stability_score)
```
